# Welcome to Seen!

## What are we doing?

Seen is a Senior Software Engineering Project that is being developed by a group of Seniors at Seattle Pacific University. The aims are to create an app which can turn a video of ASL into text to promote a new method of bridging the gap between Sign Language and Text using the power of AI!
